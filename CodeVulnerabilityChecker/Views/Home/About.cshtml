    <p class="lead">Code Scanner is a code vulnerability detecter. You can upload files or insert a code snippet as text to scan and check your C# code for vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>This prototype web application was created as part of a University coursework by <a href="http://gavinmacleod.co.uk">Gavin Macleod</a>. The focus on this web app is security and not functinality.</p>
    <p class="lead">The application is simply a prototype, so results are just estimated using a simple algorithm and string matching from a list of known vulnerabilties at <a href="https://www.circl.lu/services/cve-search/">circl.lu</a> and are not 100% accurate.</p>
    <p>It also looks pretty.</p>
